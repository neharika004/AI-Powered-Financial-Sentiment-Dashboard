# Real-Time Financial News Sentiment Dashboard

An end-to-end NLP system that analyzes **live financial news sentiment** using deep learning and presents insights through an interactive dashboard.

##  Overview
This project processes financial news headlines in real time, classifies their sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral), and visualizes the results via a web-based dashboard. It demonstrates the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and model inference to API integration and deployment.

##  Features
- Real-time financial news sentiment analysis
- LSTM-based deep learning model for NLP classification
- Interactive dashboard for filtering and visualization
- REST API integration for scalable inference

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LSTM (Deep Learning for NLP)**
- **Flask** – REST API
- **Streamlit** – Interactive dashboard
- **NLTK / Text preprocessing**

## System Workflow
1. Fetch financial news headlines  
2. Preprocess and clean text data  
3. Predict sentiment using trained LSTM model  
4. Serve predictions via Flask APIs  
5. Visualize results in a Streamlit dashboard  

##  Highlights
- Built as a **production-style ML application**, not just a notebook
- Covers the full pipeline: preprocessing → modeling → deployment
- Designed for real-time performance and usability
